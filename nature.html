<h1><p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.</p>
<p> "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. </p>
<p>The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science</p>
<p>Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

<p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura,<br>
 "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth"</p>

 In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις),<br>
 which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, 
<br>and other features of the world develop of their own accord
<p>.The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;
<br> it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophy</p></h1>
